## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the popular card game Blackjack (also known as 21) in JavaScript. The game allows you to play rounds of Blackjack, keeping track of your card values, chips, and whether you've won or lost. You can draw cards, aim for a Blackjack (21), and enjoy the thrill of the game.

## Gameplay

In this game, you play as "SV" with an initial chip balance of $6942. Here are the basic rules and how to play:

1. **Objective**: The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

2. **Starting a Round**: Click the "START GAME" button to start a round. You and the dealer will each receive two initial cards.

3. **Drawing Cards**: You can draw additional cards by clicking the "NEW CARD" button. Each card drawn adds to your hand's total value.

4. **Winning and Losing**:
   - If your hand value exceeds 21, you lose the round.
   - If your hand value reaches 21 (Blackjack), you win the round.
   - If your hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win.
   - If your hand value is the same as the dealer's, it's a tie.

5. **Chips**: Your current chip balance is displayed, and it is updated based on the outcome of each round.

6. **Messages**: Messages at the top of the screen inform you of the game's status, such as whether you can draw a new card or if you've won or lost.
