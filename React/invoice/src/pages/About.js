              Invoicer is an Invoicing application designed and built by Tanmoy, whose main purpose is to - as the name suggests - create
              and send invoices to clients, because this is something I've
              struggled with before. I hope it helps you as well.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 text-center text-xl lg:w-2/3 lg:mx-auto mt-5">
              Please note that even though most of the functionality is done,
              there are still some things to add such as saving invoices, and
              improving the Login and Logout experience. Thank you as you bear
              with me.
            </p>
